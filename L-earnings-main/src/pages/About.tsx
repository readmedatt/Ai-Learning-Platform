            <p>
              Our mission is to create a learning environment where students are motivated 
              to excel by directly tying their academic performance to the cost of education. 
              We want to make quality education accessible while encouraging students to 
              put in their best effort.

              With L-earnings, students pay upfront for courses, but they can earn back

              ensures that both students and educators are motivated to achieve the best
